Thynk Software - Software Developer Challenge V1_2
=====

Dear Candidate,

Thank you for your interest in Thynk Software.  The purpose of this challenge is to assess the candidates’ skills across the following criteria:

• Ability to easily understand the current context of a challenge and (if necessary) ask the right questions.
• Ability to properly structure the solution and code neatly.
• Data modelling skills.
• Use of appropriate design patterns.
• Presentation and communication skills.

Challenge Overview:
You are required to develop a simplistic COVID-19 PCR test management system that will help the government to manage and process requests for PCR tests.  You solution should cover the following processes:

- An administrator can allocate spaces for tests at specific locations and days.
- An individual can book at PCR or Rapid Test at a specific day and location, based on availability.
- An individual can cancel a booked test, thus making space for someone else to use that slot.
- A lab admin can set the outcome of tests.
- A tabular report which shows: booking capacity / bookings / tests / positive cases / negative cases.
You are expected to use your favourite SPA framework for the FE, ASP.NET Core MVC for Backend and SQL Server for the data layer.

Notes:

- The design of the code will be judged, the visuals / graphics / css will not.
- There is no need to implementation any Authentication / Authorization.
- The design of the solution should take into consideration large volume of requests during peak hours.
- Please list down any assumptions you’ve made, or anything you would do differently, given more time.
- Including a simulator / test project to load random data, although not mandatory would-be a plus.

Deliverables:

- An architecture diagram, indicating the aspects implemented and any recommended future enhancements.
- Any assumptions made.
- Link to repository hosting the solution.
Review the above information and the tasks below and feel free to request for any clarifications via email.  You are expected to submit your work with a week of receiving this specification, however if due to other commitments you require more time, do not hesitate to ask.
Good Luck!
